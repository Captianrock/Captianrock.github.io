The only thing was that the character movements were much more difficult to modify and change than anticipated. To summarize the storyboard, the hero kicks down a door and looks for trouble. He finds a bomb and tries to jump on it, but eventually fails.</p>

				              <p><br> This was by far the most time consuming of the project. Using the joints of the skeleton, key frames, and graph editor, I tried as best I could to arrange the skeleton to my liking. I was going for a head-strong, not very smart, heroic superhero. I hunnched him a bit, and I also made it so he's holding his two submachine guns in a very poor fashion. Was really inspiried by Rambo.</p>

				               <p><br> I wanted to make a cool effect in revealing the danger through various camera angles. At some point I even got a close up of the hero's eyes darting back and forth. In the end, however, I learned that the right staging can be very difficult if the animation is not built around it. For instance, I wanted a low angle shot of the hero, however, getting the hero to move accordingly was difficult and I ultimately had to scrape the idea. However, I tried to do it through subtle camera movements around the scene instead.</p>

				               <p><br> Explosion was something I did for fun to add extra effects and flair to my animation. The explosion was done through Maya Fluid dynamics and was suprisingly complex to create. Fuel, Turbluence, density values, and many other values had to be tweaked to make the desired effect, and the rendering time took longer than expected. However, it was a great learning expierence to play around with Maya Fluid dynamics and the end result looks ok!</p>

I ran into much more errors and roadblocks then I would have thought. Maya Dyanmics can be tricky to handle and if misused can crash one's computer easily. There are no particle effects such as wall breaking, smoke, and fireworks like originally planned as it took much more time than intially thought.</p>

Exepcially at the beginning the streched pokeball helps convey the sense that it is traveling at a remarkably fast rate. It helped convey the message while not making it totally unbelievable.

				              <img class="img-responsive" src="img/sunChange.png">
				              <p><br> 2) Created and rendered a background to show distant stars in space. Particle effects using the brush were used and displaced above the animation to create the effect.</p>
				              <img class="img-responsive" src="img/backgroundChange.png" >
				              <p><br> 3) Modified the orbit of the planets around the sun and spin of the planets to create a more intreasting visual</p>
				              <img class="img-responsive" src="img/orbitChange.png" >
				              <p><br> 4) Added a point light source to try and replicate the sun's light and also added ambient lighting to light up the scene in a unique way.</p>
